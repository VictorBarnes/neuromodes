These tutorials cover the main features of ``neuromodes``, including computing geometric eigenmodes 
of a cortical surface, decomposing and reconstructing cortical maps, simulating activity, and 
generating models of structural connectomes. For further details, please refer to the API 
documentation. If you encounter any issues, please consider opening an issue on the `GitHub 
repository <https://github.com/NSBLab/neuromodes/issues>`_.
